## Workstation specifications
- Windows 10 or Linux, 64 bit
- RAM, 8GB required, 16GB preferable

## Development IDE
**[Download Apache Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)** and install. In case you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine  as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality, but this is the oficial recommendation. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit, download and install the latest LTS version **[JDK 17](https://bell-sw.com/)**. Create then an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder.
2. Maven, download **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** and follow the **[instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. Through Maven dependency management mechanism, we will download every library needed in our projects.  Create then an environmental variable named **MVN_HOME** pointing to Maven's installation folder.
3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%/bin** and **%MVN_HOME%/bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)**.

## RDBMS
